# learning journal 6/16/17  

Today.... i am super nervous to continue with this class, i feel like i may have to retake it... nothing is sticking in my head as it did in 201... its really starting to freak me out... also im still playing catchup from last week and i work all weekend... no time to really catch up on assignments like i had hoped.... i feel really crunched for time.
