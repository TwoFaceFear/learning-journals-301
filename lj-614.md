# learning journal june 14th  

today...... today all my javascript stuff STARTED coming back to me... thats not to say i dont still feel behind, cause i definatley do, i bought Javascript: The Good Parts and it came in the mail today, so i think ill read that before bed and hopefully it will help... i do however feel completely lost wit jQuery though... ill probably get it upon completion of the codecademy prework (which i plan on doing this weekend). i really would like to know what im doing by monday next week cause after that i think ill be screwed.... anyway, its good to have brian, i really like his teaching style and we have similar taste in music which is really cool... not many people listen to the stuff i do that live in seattle...... anyway, gonna go cook some dinner and pass out... good bye future me!
