# Learning journal 6/12/17  

Today went rather smoothly for how far behind i feel. i was unable to finish my prework over the course of this last week because my pc refused to acknowledge my hard drive or any bootable media i put into it, while i eventually got it sorted out it took way too long to repair... also over my month and a half break i learned the harsh reality that duncan does not check his slack as often as i would like him too,and because of that was unable to participate in the studying he suggested vocally to me due to lack of links or written titles to google at a later date..... i still consider him a great teacer, but i do wish i wasnt so rusty with javascript now. i know i have a lot of catching up to do so i have to buckle down and do it, luckily i have some amazing friends at codefellows to help me along the way.... todays paired assignment went really smoothly with matt and i gave him a ride home after class where we had some time to get to know eachother more in depth.... considering im one of three people who werent in the 201 class previous to this 301, it will be a little more difficult to make friends, but not uch... everyone seemed to warm up to my presence by the end of the day.
